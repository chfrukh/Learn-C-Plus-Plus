## Getting Started

Start your C++ learning journey by following the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A C++ development environment (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C++ extension, [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), or any other IDE).
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).

### Project Structure

The project is organized into modules and lessons. Each module covers specific C++ concepts, and each lesson provides example code and explanations. Here's the structure:

- `Module1/`: Contains materials for Module 1.
  - `Lesson1/`: Contains materials for Lesson 1 in Module 1.
    - `example.cpp`: Example C++ code for Lesson 1.
    - `exercise.cpp`: Exercise for Lesson 1.
    - `README.md`: Detailed explanation and instructions for Lesson 1.

The project is structured in a similar way for subsequent modules and lessons.
